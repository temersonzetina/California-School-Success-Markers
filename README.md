# California-School-Success-Markers
Analysis of data from districts in California looking for variables related to student success

ML Model Overview

District Data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L-_kRhlbA8bhKE99NOrL8IEGfn16WN_a/edit#gid=1976575567 

Model 1: Linear Regression

Overview: 
Per pupil spending is one of the most commonly-used indicators to analyze correlations between K-12 education spending and student learning. We’d like to explore how per pupil spending in California might predict student achievement while holding constant district size and the percentage of students who qualify for free/reduced price lunch.

Research Question:
What is the association between per pupil spending and achievement, holding constant district size and %FRL?

Variables:
Outcome/target: SBAC scores (for one subject or both?)
Predictors/features: 
Free/reduced lunch %
Per pupil spending
District size
Teacher pay (average)

Model 2: Clustering Algorithm

Overview: 
We’d also like to create a classification system that is more substantive than the standard way of categorizing districts based on spending and family income, which is to split them into quartiles or quintiles. 

Research Question:
How can we cluster districts based on district size and percentage FRL?

Variables:
Free/reduced lunch %
Per pupil spending
